#  Masters/Clients Database

## About

This project works with files and simulates database managing system. The [task](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11Rt0YE3yQ-7vadwgulOhenmS4_-7LkM-/view) was to implement this system for specific database that we chose earlier.

## DataBase 
![DataBase](https://drive.google.com/file/d/118f7RvgxV9aUs2LDfaXOW7ceJfqkRJOj/view?usp=sharing)

![DataBaseScheme](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gtfpJAlXXgNUJPQH3UEjUZa3ciIwfpWg/view?usp=sharing)

## How to compile
Idk. I made it in XCode so the project doesn't have CMake file yet. Maybe I'll add it later. Maybe not. Also there will be a problem with saving file, because of [this file](https://github.com/dimakovua/Masters_Clients/blob/2c6f501b757aa731cab269f6595b3d6a93693e85/MastersClients/Source/DataBase.cpp) 22nd line. Create file for savings and change the path.
